# Virtainer
QEMU script supporting Linux, Windows and macOS guests

# History
Originally, I've made **MyFastEmulator**, which was a fork of the **quickemu** project meant to expose more configuration options and be faster. However, the code **was a mess** and I finally **abandonned it**. Not long after, I decided to start another QEMU script named **Virtainer** which would be coded from scratch using **quickemu**'s and **MyFastEmulator**'s code.

# Features
- **Full support** for **Linux, Windows and macOS guests**
- **Made around** the **latest QEMU version**
- **Very fast** and **easy to use**
- **And more!**

# Download
To get a copy of Virtainer, just clone the repository via ``git``, or just download it as a zip file via GitHub.
